1) Had to use a Classic Storage Account
2) Install this package
https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions (ignore powershell error for newtonsoft)

Queue and Plan Information:
https://www.schaeflein.net/azure-webjobs-free-tier/
1) have to have at least Basic or Standard Tier for Plan
2) Always On in Application Settings for the App Service

I had to manaully start the WebJob under WebJobs in Azure to see errors
*Complained about Storage Account connection strings
*Set those in the App Settings in Azure even though they are in the app.settings

Hard to debug
Hard to figure why it won't start
Have to use a Classic Storage Account
Can't use the same Storage Account unless you specify an Id because its a singleton and will lock

1)The WebJobber stopped working locally, when I deleted the Storage Account and made a new one it started working again
2)I suspect that when I deleted the WebJob in Test, it had put a lock on the Storage Account and it was never released

Pre:
1) Create 3 Classic Storage Accounts, Dev, Test and Prod
2) Install Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions
3) Install SlowCheetah, make sure to uninstall any older SlowCheetah Packages and Extensions

Dev:
4) Create WebJob Project and set it up the way you like
5) Setup Test and Prod Configuration and create the app.configs
6) Your function must be in the auto-created Functions Class
7) Set your Storage Account Connectionstrings in app.config
8) See POC code on how to call the Function

Deployment
9) When you deploy for the first time, put the connection strings in the application settings of the web app, I noticed it complained if it wasn't in there
10) Make sure you select Always On
